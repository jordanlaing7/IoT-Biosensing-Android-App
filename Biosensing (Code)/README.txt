This directory is the Android Studio project folder. All the folders and files except the
Database folder is used by Android Studio to build the project. When trying to open this as
a project in Android Studio, open the superdirectory App-developers-for-biosensing-2.0 and
then select the directory Biosensing (Code) as the project. 

The Database subdirectory contains the backup to the SQL Server database this project uses.
Restoring the database from the backup is very easy; instructions are in the Installation
Guide. Once the database is restored, you can continue following the instructins in the guide
to create the necessary login using SQL Server Management Studio, or simply run the SQL script
located in the same subdirectory.
